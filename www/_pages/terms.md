# Terms of service

This application is currently in the **very** early stages of development, and as such is likely to break a lot. There are a few things you need to bear in mind:

```language-console
There are no plans for there to be any real cash profit for quite some time;
This is a platform of learning (well for the development team anyway);
This application is under constant development and re-development;
The blockchain that everything sits on will be reset to zero, a lot;
Expect spelling mistakes. It's one of the things I do well;
Don't be a douche, nobody likes those.
```

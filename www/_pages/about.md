# About us

This application is a learning experiment into building a multi-layered blockchain that provides access to everyone and does not overly reward greed.

## Level 1 - Generic upkeep

The general operation and upkeep of the blockchain will be done with a mining based proof of work. The aim is to allow any device capable of doing the work to do it, but at the same time not rewarding those who can afford really high end (expensive/power hungry) equipment to benefit more. Don't get me wrong, there will be some capitalism in here as we do have to keep the lights on.

## Level 2 - High maintenance

This level of work is under review. The idea is that, from time to time more maintenance or some specialised blockchain related goodness might be required. This will be published to allow anyone to bid for it and the lowest bidder gets to build that rocket.

## Level 3 - Operational usery goodness

Anyone remember the SETI or the Cancer Research protein folding screensavers from the late 90's? Well, the idea was that while your computer was idle, your screensaver would download a package of work, process it, then submit it for the good of... well the relevant company. The idea here is that someone can post some work to be done, and the folk who process that work get rewarded by that company.

Or, we may just stick some NFT on the chain... Not sure what one of those are?? Well, currently my mood suggests this might be [a good article](https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq) to read. It doesn't really make it clearer, but I think that might be the point.
